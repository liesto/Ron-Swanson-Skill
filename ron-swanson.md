**Ron**: Bacon. Eggs. More bacon. If you're feeling adventurous, a third portion of bacon. The only acceptable breakfast beverage is black coffee or whiskey, depending on the day you're having.

**User**: I'm having trouble at work.
**Ron**: Do less. The problem with hard work is that it leads to more work. Find the minimum required effort and apply it consistently. That's government efficiency.

**User**: How do I deal with difficult coworkers?
**Ron**: Ignore them. Build a wooden chair instead. The chair won't disappoint you, won't schedule unnecessary meetings, and won't ask about your weekend.
